"indications for echocardiograms varied widely , with the top five being chest pain , dyspnea / fatigue , coronary artery disease , aortic valve disease , and heart failure .",心脏超声波检查的指征非常不一，最常见的五种检查项目分别是胸痛、呼吸困难/疲劳、冠心病、主动脉瓣疾病和心力衰竭。
the adjusted hazard ratio for mortality was 1.71 when the LVEF ≥ 70 % and 1.73 with LVEFs in the 35 % -40 % range .,调整后的死亡风险比在LVEF≥70%时为1.71，在LVEF为35%～40%时为1.73。
"clinicians emphasize LVEF , despite its imprecision , in treatment decisions .",尽管其不准确性，临床医生仍然强调心脏功能减退率（LVEF）在治疗决策中的作用。
this study had clear confounders that could not be fully adjusted for .,这项研究有明显的纰漏因素无法完全调整。
"as an example , the structured fields in the database for indications for the echocardiogram could fail to capture the complete clinical picture of the patient undergoing the test .",结构化的数据库字段，比如心脏超声的检查项目，有时无法完全反映出检查对象的临床病情。
"Hyperdynamic LV function ( LVEF , ≥ 70 % ) is likely associated with other clinical comorbidities that confer increased risk ( e.g. , liver failure ) but were not fully accounted for in the study .",超动力心肌功能（LVEF，≥70%）可能与其他临床并发症相关联，这些并发症会增加风险（例如肝功能衰竭），但在研究中并没有充分考虑到这些因素。
"in a large observational study , statin discontinuers were vulnerable to later cardiovascular hospitalizations .",在一项大型观察性研究中，起始服用他汀类药物后后来再次患有心血管疾病住院的患者显得脆弱。

Chinese:

仍有一个问题是，撤销他汀类药物是否意味着更高的风险；理想情况下，一个试验将解决这个问题。"
studies suggest that fluoride exposure during brain development might negatively affect neurocognitive outcomes in children .,研究表明，在大脑发育过程中暴露于氟化物可能会对儿童的神经认知能力产生负面影响。

"but methodologies are improving in this area , making these findings potentially concerning , particularly at the population level .",但是在这个领域的方法正在改进，这些发现可能令人担忧，特别是在人口水平上。
"clinicians should be prepared to discuss the possible positive and negative effects of fluoride exposure , since parents may ask whether they should avoid giving fluoridated water to their young children or drinking it during pregnancy .","医师应准备好讨论氟暴露的可能负面和正面影响，因为家长可能会问是否应该避免让幼儿饮用含氟水或在怀孕期间饮用含氟水。

Chinese:

医师应准备好讨论氟暴露的可能负面和正面影响，因为家长可能会问是否应该避免让幼儿饮用含氟水或在怀孕期间饮用含氟水。"
"because prenatal fluoride is not believed to benefit the fetus , it is reasonable to recommend that women reduce fluoride intake during pregnancy .",因为预防浓度的氟化物不被认为有益于胎儿，所以建议妇女在怀孕期间减少氟摄入量是合理的。

"moreover , over the course of 52 weeks , a decrease of 0.50 percentage points in mean glycated hemoglobin levels was observed with liraglutide , whereas an increase of 0.80 percentage points was observed with placebo - an increase similar to previously reported changes in glycated hemoglobin levels observed over 12 months in youth with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin with or without insulin.14,15","此外，在52周的治疗过程中，平均糖化血红蛋白水平在使用利拉多巴的患者中出现了0.50个百分点的降低，而在使用安慰剂的患者中则出现了0.80个百分点的升高，这与在使用了服用了二甲双胍或者二甲双胍加胰岛素治疗12个月的2型糖尿病青少年观察到的糖化血红蛋白水平的变化相似。14,15"

Table 1 lists the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients overall and according to the presence or absence of myocardial viability .,表1列出了患者总体及根据心肌可活性存在或缺失情况的人口学和临床特征。
"although CABG plus medical therapy was associated with a lower incidence of death from any cause than medical therapy alone ( Figure 1A ) , the interaction between the presence or absence of myocardial viability and the beneficial effect of CABG plus medical therapy over medical therapy alone was not significant ( P = 0.34 ) ( Figure 1B and 1C ) .",尽管CABG加上医疗疗法与仅有医疗疗法相比，死于任何原因的发生率较低(图1A)，但心肌可活性相关因素对CABG加上医疗疗法超越仅有医疗疗法的有益影响并不显著(P=0.34)(图1B与1C)。
left VENTRICULAR EJECTION FRACTION AND SUBSEQUENT OUTCOMES,"Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is a measure of how much blood the left ventricle of the heart pumps out with each beat. LVEF is an important predictor of future cardiovascular events, such as heart failure, stroke, and death."
"of the remaining 567 patients , 318 ( 56 % ) had paired imaging at baseline and at 4 months for measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction .",在剩余的567名病人中，有318名（56%）在基线和4个月时进行了成对的影像检查，以测量左心室射血分数。
"in contrast , among patients without myocardial viability , there was no improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction in either treatment group ( Figure 3 ) .",相比之下，在没有心肌可活力的病人中，两组治疗都没有改善左心室射血分数（图3）。
our study showed a lower incidence of death from any cause with CABG plus medical therapy than with medical therapy alone .,我们的研究表明，CABG加上医疗治疗相比仅靠医疗治疗，死亡率较低。
"however , the tests of interaction between myocardial viability and treatment effect of CABG were not significant for any of the three end points .",然而，对于三个终点来说，心肌活力与CABG治疗效果之间的测试并不显著。
"therefore , we must conclude that there is no statistical evidence of association between myocardial viability and benefit from CABG .",因此，我们必须得出结论，肌酐与CABG的益处之间没有统计学证据相关联。
"a number of various possibilities , alone or in combination , may account for the negative results of our study .","There are a number of possible explanations for the negative results of our study, either alone or in combination."
"it is certainly possible that a true biologic interaction exists between myocardial viability and the benefit of revascularization and that we were unable to unveil it because of the relatively small number of patients , especially patients without myocardial viability , included in our study .",有可能存在一种真正的心肌活性与再血管化益处之间的生物学相互作用，我们之所以没能发现它，是因为我们的研究对象相对较少，特别是没有心肌活性的患者。
"a complementary explanation is that the physiological complexity underpinning the potential therapeutic benefit of surgical revascularization cannot be surmised from the results of a single test of myocardial viability , particularly when those results are expressed in a dichotomous fashion ( i.e. , patients having or not having viability ) .",一个补充解释是，手术再血管化的潜在治疗效益的生理复杂性无法从一项心肌可活性测试的结果中推断出来，特别是当这些结果以二元化的方式表示（即患者有或没有可活性）时。
"in fact , previous results from the STICH trial showed that the degree of left ventricular systolic dysfunction and remodeling and the number of stenotic coronary arteries appear to be stronger determinants of the benefit of revascularization than myocardial viability.19",实际上，STICH试验的先前结果表明，心肌功能障碍和心肌重构的程度以及狭窄的冠状动脉数量似乎是决定再血管化效益的更强因素。19
patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy often present with complex and challenging clinical scenarios .,缺血性心肌病患者经常出现复杂而具挑战性的临床情况。
"therefore , the results of tests for detection of viable myocardium must be interpreted within the context of the multiplicity of factors necessary to reach the best treatment decision for each patient .",因此，必须在每个患者的最佳治疗决策的背景下解释存活的心肌的检测结果。
"these factors include not only the results of functional tests but also the anatomical extent of coronary and myocardial disease , as well as the regional correspondence between segmental left ventricular dysfunction and the likelihood of successful revascularization of the corresponding coronary arteries .",这些因素不仅包括功能测试的结果，还包括心冠和心肌病的解剖范围，以及段落左心室功能障碍与相应心冠血管成功再通的区域对应关系。
a putative mechanism that mediates the benefit of CABG among patients with myocardial viability is the improvement in left ventricular systolic function that results from revascularization .,一种据称可以使心肌有生命力的人从CABG中受益的机制是，通过再血管化改善左心室收缩功能。
"in our study , a modest but significant increase in left ventricular ejection fraction at 4 months was indeed observed among patients with viable myocardium .",在我们的研究中，4个月后可见心脏组织中离心率的轻微但显著增加。
"nevertheless , when the amount of viable myocardium was assessed as a continuous variable , no association was observed between the extent of viability and the magnitude of improvement in left ventricular function either with or without CABG , findings that indicate that the quantitative relationship between these variables is weak .",尽管如此，当可生存的心肌的数量被评估为一个连续变量时，无论是否有CABG，在左心室功能的改善程度上都没有观察到可生存程度与这些变量之间的量化关系是微弱的。
"there was no association between improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction at 4 months and subsequent survival , nor was there a significant interaction between myocardial viability and changes in left ventricular ejection fraction with regard to death from any cause or death from cardiovascular causes .","There was no association between improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction at 4 months and subsequent survival, nor was there a significant interaction between myocardial viability and changes in left ventricular ejection fraction with regard to death from any cause or death from cardiovascular causes."
"thus , our results suggest that abatement or reversal of left ventricular systolic dysfunction is not a critical mechanism involved in mediating the beneficial effect of CABG in these patients .",因此，我们的结果表明，在这些患者中，减轻或逆转左心室心脏功能不足并不是促使CABG有益影响的关键机制。

"it must also be noted that the assessment of changes in left ventricular ejection fraction was performed only among patients with paired studies at baseline and 4 months , with the resultant reduction in the number of observations .",需要指出的是，对左心室射血分数变化的评估仅在基线和4个月的配对研究中进行，这导致观察结果的减少。
"finally , our findings are based on the assessment of myocardial viability with either SPECT or dobutamine echocardiography .",最终，我们的研究结果是基于对心肌活性的SPECT或Dobutamine超声心动图的评估。
"the study did not include the routine performance of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging , which has become an accepted technique for the assessment of myocardial scarring .",这项研究并没有包括所谓的常规性心脏磁共振成像，而这已经成为评估心肌瘢痕的一种普遍接受的技术。
