"however , the tests of interaction between myocardial viability and treatment effect of CABG were not significant for any of the three end points .","['然而,心血管可行性和CABG的治疗效应之间的相互作用测试在三个终点中都没有显著。']"
"therefore , we must conclude that there is no statistical evidence of association between myocardial viability and benefit from CABG .","['因此,我们必须得出结论,心血管可行性与CABG的好处之间没有统计证据的联系。']"
"a number of various possibilities , alone or in combination , may account for the negative results of our study .","['多种不同的可能性,单独或结合,可能会对我们的研究的负面结果负责。']"
"it is certainly possible that a true biologic interaction exists between myocardial viability and the benefit of revascularization and that we were unable to unveil it because of the relatively small number of patients , especially patients without myocardial viability , included in our study .","['毫无疑问,在心脏病的可行性和复发的好处之间存在真正的生物相互作用,并且由于我们研究中所涉及的患者,尤其是没有心脏病的可行性患者,相对较少的数量,我们无法揭示它。']"
"a complementary explanation is that the physiological complexity underpinning the potential therapeutic benefit of surgical revascularization cannot be surmised from the results of a single test of myocardial viability , particularly when those results are expressed in a dichotomous fashion ( i.e. , patients having or not having viability ) .","['一个补充的解释是,基于外科复发的潜在治疗好处的生理复杂性不能从单一心脏可行性测试的结果中超越,特别是当这些结果以二元性方式表达(即有或没有可行性患者)。']"
"in fact , previous results from the STICH trial showed that the degree of left ventricular systolic dysfunction and remodeling and the number of stenotic coronary arteries appear to be stronger determinants of the benefit of revascularization than myocardial viability.19","['事实上,STICH试验的先前结果表明,左腹部系统性功能障碍和修复的程度以及甲状腺甲状腺的数量似乎比心血管生存能力更为决定性。']"
patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy often present with complex and challenging clinical scenarios .,['患有催化性心脏病的患者经常面临复杂和挑战性的临床场景。']

a putative mechanism that mediates the benefit of CABG among patients with myocardial viability is the improvement in left ventricular systolic function that results from revascularization .,['在患有心血管可行性患者中介CABG的好处的突出机制是由于重复性而导致的左侧阴道系统功能的改善。']
"in our study , a modest but significant increase in left ventricular ejection fraction at 4 months was indeed observed among patients with viable myocardium .","['在我們的研究中,在4個月的左<unk>排泄分子中,實際上在患有生存性心臟病的患者中發現了一種微不足道但有意義的增加。']"
"nevertheless , when the amount of viable myocardium was assessed as a continuous variable , no association was observed between the extent of viability and the magnitude of improvement in left ventricular function either with or without CABG , findings that indicate that the quantitative relationship between these variables is weak .","['然而,当可行的心血管量被评为连续变量时,没有观察到可行的程度和左肢功能的改善程度之间的联系,无论是与或没有CABG,这些发现表明这些变量之间的定量关系很弱。']"

"in contrast , the rate of distant recurrence at 9 years exceeded 10 % among women with high clinical risk and an intermediate recurrence score who received endocrine therapy alone ( 12.3 ± 2.4 % ) and in those with a high recurrence score who received chemoendocrine therapy ( 15.2 ± 3.3 % ) .","['相比之下,在9年间的遥远复发率超过了高临床风险和中间复发率的女性10%,仅接受内分泌疗法(12.3 ± 2.4%)和接受化内分泌疗法(15.2 ± 3.3%)的高复发率的女性。']"
the integration of genomic and clinical information may provide a more accurate estimation of prognosis for individual patients than could be provided by either the genomic or clinical information alone.16,"['基因组和临床信息的集成可能为个人患者提供更准确的预测估计,而仅仅基因组或临床信息可以提供。']"
"although TAILORx showed that endocrine therapy was noninferior to chemoendocrine therapy in women with an intermediate recurrence score ( a score of 11 to 25 ) , 7 we performed an exploratory analysis in accordance with recommended guidelines in order to determine whether any subgroup might derive some benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.17","['虽然TAILORx 表明,内分泌疗法与中间重复率(11至25分)的妇女的内分泌疗法不低,但我们根据推荐的指导方针进行了探索分析,以确定任何子组是否可以从补充化疗中获得某种好处。']"
"the interaction among age , recurrence score , and chemotherapy benefit observed in TAILORx is therefore consistent with the greater treatment effect of adjuvant chemotherapy in younger women .","['因此,在 TAILORx 中观察到的年龄、重复率和化疗益处之间的相互作用与年轻妇女的辅助化疗的更大的治疗效应一致。']"
"given the incremental benefits observed with ovarian suppression plus tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor as compared with tamoxifen alone in premenopausal women21,22 and the low percentage of premenopausal women who received ovarian suppression in TAILORx , it is possible that similar incremental benefits observed in younger women who received chemotherapy and had a recurrence score of 16 to 25 could be achieved with ovarian suppression and an aromatase inhibitor , as observed in other trials.21,22","['鉴于卵巢抑制以及<unk>化<unk>或<unk>化<unk>抑制剂与<unk>化<unk>单独相比的卵巢抑制剂的增加效益21,22和在甲状腺抑制剂中服用卵巢抑制剂的甲状腺抑制剂中服用卵巢抑制剂的低百分比,可能类似的增加效益在接受化疗的年轻妇女中服用,并且有16至25的重复率可以通过卵巢抑制剂和<unk>化<unk>抑制剂获得,如其他研究所观察到的。']"

"when the recurrence score was further stratified according to clinical risk among TAILORx patients as described here , there was no evidence of chemotherapy benefit at 9 years in the subgroup with a low clinical risk and a recurrence score of 16 to 20 , whereas the addition of chemotherapy was associated with lower rates of distant recurrence ranging from approximately 6 to 8 percentage points among women with a recurrence score of 21 to 25 , irrespective of clinical risk , and a recurrence score of 16 to 20 with high clinical risk .","['当重复率按临床风险进一步分类时,如下所述,在低临床风险和16至20重复率的子组中9年没有化疗益处的证据,而化疗的补充与距离重复率较低,从21至25重复率的女性中约6至8个百分点,无论临床风险如何,以及高临床风险的16至20重复率。']"
"the level of clinical risk also added prognostic information for women with a high recurrence score who were receiving chemoendocrine therapy , irrespective of age , and thus could be used to identify patients with very high risk for whom testing of new therapeutic approaches in clinical trials is warranted .","['临床风险水平还添加了高重复率的妇女的预测信息,这些妇女无论年龄如何接受化内分泌疗法,因此可以用来识别患有非常高的风险的患者,他们在临床试验中可以测试新的治疗方法。']"

"many of the retrospective analyses including large numbers of patients have suggested a benefit of lymphadenectomy , and accordingly , patients have been exposed to this procedure over the decades .","['许多回顾分析,包括大量的患者,提出了淋巴细菌的好处,因此,患者在几十年来一直受到这种程序的曝光。']"
"however , evaluations of lymphadenectomy as compared with no lymphadenectomy in nonrandomized studies are prone to several biases .","['然而,与非 randomized 研究中没有 lymphadenectomy 相比,Lymphadenectomy 的评估有几种偏见。']"
it is difficult to account for such a bias even if the surgeon is aware of the pitfalls of retrospective analyses .,"['对于这种混乱,即使外科医生知道回顾分析的漏洞,也很难承担责任。']"
a previously reported prospectively randomized international trial of lymphadenectomy also did not show a significant effect on overall survival among patients with advanced ovarian cancer.13,['此前报告的预期随机的国际淋巴细胞检测也没有对患有先进卵巢癌患者的整体生存产生显著影响。']
"however , the trial was criticized for several reasons , including the fact that centers had not been assessed for quality before participation in the trial , and it did not lead to the abandonment of the procedure in advanced ovarian cancer .","['然而,审判因多种原因受到批评,其中包括在参加审判之前没有对中心的质量进行评估,并且没有导致先进卵巢癌的程序被遗弃。']"
"to avoid heterogeneous surgical quality as a potential weakness in our trial , we performed prospective evaluation of all centers .","['为了避免异性外科品质作为我们试验中的潜在弱点,我们进行了所有中心的前瞻性评估。']"
all centers had to prove their proficiency in performing a complete lymphadenectomy before being qualified to participate in the trial .,['所有中心都必须证明他们在进行完整的淋巴细胞检测之前有资格参加试验。']
"accordingly , the quality of surgery and the numbers of resected lymph nodes were higher than in previous gynecologic oncologic clinical trials analyzing this issue .","['因此,手术的质量和恢复的淋巴节的数量比以前的妇科肿瘤临床试验分析这个问题更高。']"
resection of lymph nodes in patients with residual tumor may remove some tumor in the lymph nodes but will not change the status of residual tumor in the abdomen .,"['在患有残留肿瘤的患者中,淋巴节的恢复可能会在淋巴节中移除某些肿瘤,但不会改变腹部残留肿瘤的状态。']"
"consequently , the prognostic effect of residual tumor in advanced ovarian cancer may mask the potential benefit of lymphadenectomy .","['因此,在先进的卵巢癌中剩余肿瘤的预测效果可能会掩盖淋巴细胞的潜在好处。']"
we accounted for this assumed shortcoming by recruiting only patients who had undergone macroscopically complete resection .,"['我们承担了这种假设的缺陷,仅通过招募经历了宏观完整的恢复的患者。']"
"however , this procedure did not provide a benefit , even though 55.7 % of the patients in the lymphadenectomy group in our trial had positive nodes .","['然而,这种程序并没有带来任何好处,尽管在我们的试验中,55.7%的淋巴细胞组患者有积极的节点。']"
we have to conclude that a macroscopically complete resection may not be improved by increasing the radicality of the procedure .,"['我们必须得出结论,通过增加程序的激进性,绝不能改善宏观完整的恢复。']"
"despite our efforts to prospectively address the concerns raised about the previous trial , we also did not find a beneficial role of lymphadenectomy .","['尽管我们努力前瞻性解决以前的审查所引起的担忧,但我们还没有发现淋巴细胞学的有益作用。']"

the relatively high morbidity and mortality in the lymphadenectomy group in our trial may be questioned .,"['在我们的研究中,淋巴细胞群体的相对较高的病率和死亡率可能会受到质疑。']"
"in a similar trial involving patients with early ovarian cancer , morbidity was lower than in our trial.16","['在类似的研究中,患有早期卵巢癌的患者,病率低于我们的研究。']"
"in early disease , lymphadenectomy adds approximately 1 hour to a short overall surgery .","['在早期疾病中,淋巴细胞肿瘤会增加大约1小时的短期整体手术。']"
"furthermore , patients with early disease commonly do not have symptoms or a large amount of ascites and are generally healthier than patients with more advanced disease .","['此外,患有早期疾病的患者通常没有症状或大量的<unk>疹,并且一般比患有更先进的疾病的患者更健康。']"
"lymphadenectomy in advanced disease also adds only 1 hour of surgery , but this is after a long and much more complex operation .","['先进疾病的淋巴肿瘤也只增加了1小时的手术,但这是经过长时间和更复杂的手术后。']"
"the latter factor explains , for example , the higher incidence of repeat laparotomies in the lymphadenectomy group resulting from complications that at first glance were not directly associated with the removal of lymph nodes .","['最后的因素解释了,例如,在淋巴细胞组中重复的拉帕罗托米亚的发病率较高,这些发病并发症在第一眼看不直接与淋巴节的移除有关。']"
"in part , this finding may be related to the fact that treatment was performed in specialized surgical centers , which have several positive factors that have been associated with better outcomes , including high surgical volume , 18,19 frequent study participation , 20 and high rates of macroscopically complete resection.21,22","['部分情况下,这项发现可能与治疗在专门的手术中心进行的事实有关,其中有几个积极因素与更好的结果有关,包括高手术量、1819次频繁研究参与、20次和宏观复发率高。']"
"however , the patients who underwent randomization were highly selected , as indicated by the number of registered patients relative to the number of patients who underwent randomization .","['然而,经过随机化的患者被强烈选择,根据注册患者的数量,与随机化患者的数量相比。']"

"we did not allow randomization without registration at least 1 day before surgery , to avoid an intraoperative selection bias .","['我们不允许无注册的随机化,至少在手术前一天,以避免内手术选择的混乱。']"
the registered population comes very close to reflecting standard practice .,['注册人口非常接近反映标准实践。']
"this approach led to a high percentage of patients ( 65.7 % ) not undergoing randomization , for several reasons .",['这种方法导致患者(65.7%)因多种原因不受随机化的高比例。']
one of the reasons for nonrandomization was incomplete resection intraabdominally .,['非随机化的原因之一是内腹部不完整的恢复。']
"thus , the poorest prognostic group was not included - a group of patients who were unlikely to benefit from lymphadenectomy .","['因此,最差的预测组没有被列入 - 一个不可能从淋巴细胞学中受益的患者群体。']"
"in conclusion , in this trial involving patients with macroscopically complete resection of advanced ovarian cancer and clinically negative lymph nodes , systematic pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy was not associated with better outcomes than no lymphadenectomy and was associated with a higher incidence of postoperative complications .","['在结论中,这项研究涉及患有先进卵巢癌和临床负性淋巴节的宏观完整复发的患者,系统性阴道和寄生淋巴细胞没有比没有淋巴细胞的结果更好,并且与手术后并发症的发病率更高有关。']"

effect OF BIRTH WEIGHT ON BMI DYNAMICS DURING CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE,['出生体重对婴儿和青少年持续的BMI动态的影响']
children who were large for gestational age at birth continued to have a consistently higher BMI during childhood and adolescence than children who had an appropriate weight for gestational age or were small for gestational age ( Figure 4A ) .,['出生时为怀孕年龄长的儿童在童年和青少年时期仍然比怀孕年龄适当体重或怀孕年龄较小的儿童的BMI高得多(图4A)。']

effect OF MATERNAL WEIGHT ON BMI DYNAMICS DURING CHILDHOOD,['母体重对 BMI 动态持续儿童体重的影响']
"we found that children of mothers who were overweight or obese had higher birth weights and , thereafter , increasingly higher BMI than children of mothers who were not overweight or obese .","['我们发现,过重或肥胖的母亲的孩子有较高的出生体重,随后比没有过重或肥胖的母亲的孩子更高的BMI。']"
"overall , these data confirm maternal overweight as an independent risk factor for childhood obesity ; however , maternal overweight did not affect the timing or dynamics of BMI development during childhood .","['总体而言,这些数据证实了母亲体重过重作为儿童肥胖的独立风险因素;然而,母亲体重过重并没有影响儿童体重发育的时间或动态。']"
a majority of children who were obese by 3 years of age remained obese into adolescence .,['大多数在3岁时肥胖的儿童在青春期仍然肥胖。']
"among adolescents who were overweight or obese , the most excessive weight gain ( i.e. , the most rapid BMI acceleration ) had occurred between 2 and 6 years of age .","['在超重或肥胖的青少年中,体重增加最多(即最快的BMI加速)发生在2至6岁之间。']"

epidemiologic studies have shown that the risk of childhood obesity is far greater among children with an earlier or pronounced adiposity rebound.26,"['流行病学研究表明,患童年肥胖的风险在患有早期或明显肥胖的儿童中更高。']"
an upward deviation in BMI percentile may be an even more direct predictor of later adiposity.27,['BMI百分比的上升偏差可能是一个更直接的后期脂肪预测器。']
"therefore , the specific dynamics and patterns of BMI in this early childhood period , rather than the absolute BMI , appear to be important factors in identifying children at risk for obesity later in life.28","['因此,在这个早期童年期间的BMI的具体动态和模式,而不是绝对的BMI,似乎是确定儿童在后期生命中的肥胖风险的重要因素。']"
"nevertheless , a considerable correlation exists between a high BMI during early childhood and prevalence of obesity later in life.4,9,12,29,30","['然而,在早期童年时的高BMI和后期肥胖的发病率之间存在着显著的相互关系。']"
the probability that young children who are obese will return to a normal weight in adolescence appears to be less than 20 % and decreases further with age .,"['在青春期,肥胖的年轻儿童恢复正常体重的可能性似乎低于20%,随着年龄的增长而进一步下降。']"
this finding may imply distinct dynamic BMI patterns in children with normal weight as compared with obese children .,"['这种发现可能意味着与肥胖儿童相比,正常体重的儿童中有不同的动态BMI模式。']"
"our data further showed that children who were large for gestational age at birth retained a higher BMI throughout childhood and adolescence , and almost half these children became overweight or obese in adolescence .","['我们的数据进一步表明,在出生时长大的婴儿在童年和青春期保持了较高的BMI,近一半的这些婴儿在青春期变成肥胖或肥胖。']"
"rather , a rapid weight gain during childhood in children who had been small for gestational age at birth , even with the absolute BMI remaining within normal limits , was associated with later insulin resistance and coronary events.34","['相比之下,在出生时怀孕年龄较小的儿童童年期间的快速体重增加,即使在正常范围内保持的绝对BMI,也与后期胰岛素抵抗和冠状事件有关。']"
the dynamic of increasing BMI does not end with adolescence but continues into adulthood.4,"['增加BMI的动态不会在青春期结束,而是持续到成年。']"
"obesity rates among adults are considerably higher than those among children , and most adults with obesity had had normal weight in childhood.35","['成年人肥胖率远高于儿童,大多数肥胖的成年人在童年中体重正常。']"
"however , if obesity does develop in childhood and continues through adolescence , it tends to persist ; most obese adolescents become obese adults.4","['然而,如果肥胖症在童年发展,并在青春期继续,它倾向于持续;大多数肥胖的青少年变成肥胖的成年人。']"

"this is no surprise , since phenotyping is an imperfect standard , particularly for isolates with embB mutations.6,13,16","['这并不奇怪,因为现象是不完美的标准,尤其是与 embB 突变的隔离。']"
"for the collections that were not enriched for resistance , however , these targets were met for all drugs , and they were also met for the predictions of pansusceptibility in all collections .","['然而,对于不为抵抗而丰富的收藏品,所有药物都满足了这些目标,并在所有收藏品中也满足了可接受性预测。']"

"third , no predictions were attempted for isolates that contained genomic variation of unknown association in genes affecting isoniazid .","['第三,没有任何预测被尝试的隔离物,其中含有基因变异的未知的组合在影响伊索尼亚西德的基因。']"
this maximized confidence in the isoniazid predictions that were made .,['这种最大限度的信心在以色列的预测。']

such phenomena are thus likely to explain the majority of isolates that were predicted to be resistant yet were phenotypically susceptible .,"['因此,这种现象很可能解释大多数被预测是抵抗性的孤立物,但却是显而易见的。']"
they are also the most likely reason for the prediction of pansusceptible drug profiles being more accurate than the prediction of profiles that are apparently resistant to one or more drugs .,"['它们也是最可能的预测药物资料的预测比预测药物资料的预测更准确,显然是对一个或多个药物的抵抗性。']"
one limitation of our study was our inability to definitively resolve most discrepancies because of the scale and cost of repeat sequencing and phenotyping .,"['我們的研究的一個限制是我們無法最終解決大多數差異,因為重複序列和現象的規模和成本。']"
this was most worrisome for phenotypically resistant isolates that were predicted to be susceptible .,"['这是最令人担忧的现象抵抗的隔离物,被预测是敏感的。']"
"for these discrepancies , possible explanations include further limitations of our study - namely , phenotypic error , resistant minority bacterial populations that went undetected by sequencing , mechanisms of resistance unknown to us , or laboratory labeling error .","['对于这些差异,可能的解释包括我们研究的进一步限制 - 即, 现象错误, 抵抗少数细菌群体未被排序发现, 抵抗机制未知我们, 或实验室标签错误。']"
"to maintain or improve accuracy , ongoing surveillance for the phenotypic effect of new mutations will be required .","['要保持或提高准确性,将需要对新突变的现象效应进行持续的监测。']"
another limitation is the use of phenotypic susceptibility data as the standard .,['另一个限制是使用现象敏感性数据作为标准。']

"in an analysis of the 466 time points at which antibiotics were prescribed despite low procalcitonin levels , the most common reasons were clinician belief that a bacterial infection was present ( 183 time points , 39.3 % ) , clinician belief that the patient had an acute COPD exacerbation requiring antibiotics ( 158 time points , 33.9 % ) , and prescription occurring before the procalcitonin result was available ( 92 time points , 19.7 % ) .","['在分析的466时间点,在抗生素被处方,尽管低的procalcitonin水平,最常见的原因是诊所的信念,细菌感染存在(183时间点,39.3%),诊所的信念,患者有急性COPD加剧需要抗生素(158时间点,33.9%),和处方发生之前的procalcitonin结果是可用的(92时间点,19.7%)。']"
"for the incidence of individual outcomes of the composite safety outcome , admission to the intensive care unit , and subsequent emergency department visits , the 95 % confidence interval of the differences in risk between the groups excluded the prespecified noninferiority margin of 4.5 percentage points , with upper limits ranging from 0.1 to 3.9 percentage points ( Tables S5 and S6 in the Supplementary Appendix ) .","['对于复合安全结果的个别结果的影响、入院密集护理单位和随后的紧急部门访问,各组之间的风险差异的95%信任间隔排除了预定不低度边界为4.5个百分点,上限为0.1到3.9个百分点(附件中的S5和S6表)。']"

there are several possible explanations for this finding .,['有几个可能的解释这个发现。']
"patients with lower procalcitonin levels also had fewer clinical features of infection , and in that context , procalcitonin probably provided a modest amount of additional information to guide decisions .","['患有较低的procalcitonin水平的患者也有较少的感染的临床特征,在这种情况下,procalcitonin可能提供了一小量额外的信息来指导决策。']"

"however , these secondary analyses were exploratory , and the differences were largely nonsignificant .","['然而,这些次要分析是探索性的,差异大多是毫无意义的。']"
"possible reasons include differences in case mix , design , and setting .",['可能的原因包括案例混合、设计和设置的差异。']
"previously , the largest effects on minimizing antibiotic exposure were observed among patients without pneumonia.11,42","['此前,抗生素暴露的最大影响在没有肺炎的患者中被观察到。']"
"we enrolled a high proportion of such patients , most of whom had low procalcitonin levels , which provided ample opportunity to detect an effect of the intervention on antibiotic exposure .","['我们注册了大量的患者,其中大多数患有较低的procalcitonin水平,这提供了广泛的机会,以检测干预对抗生素暴露的影响。']"
adherence to the procalcitonin guideline in previous trials was heavily mandated .,"['在以前的试验中,遵守Procalcitonin指令被强烈授权。']"
"in the decade since the largest previous trial completed enrollment , 11 there has been increased attention to antibiotic overuse and stewardship43 and movement toward shorter courses of antibiotic treatment based on evidence44 and guidelines.45","['在十年来,自最大的先前试验完成登记以来,11人对抗生素过量使用和管理的注意力增加了43以及基于证据和指南的抗生素治疗的更短时间的运动。']"
such shifts in practice may have resulted in less opportunity for the intervention we examined to further reduce antibiotic exposure .,"['在实践中,这种变化可能导致我们研究的干预进一步减少抗生素暴露的机会较少。']"
"strengths of our trial design included the fact that we ensured that serial procalcitonin results were delivered to clinicians in multiple emergency departments and hospitals , and we conducted the trial in a setting in which best practice based on current guidelines was promoted and in which background procalcitonin use was minimal .",['我們的測試設計的強度包括我們確保在多個緊急辦公室和醫院的臨床醫生傳達連續進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行進行。']
"we also recruited patients for whom clinicians had uncertainty regarding the benefit of antibiotics , a feature that previous trials were criticized for lacking , 49,50 and the trial was well powered to detect small differences in antibiotic exposure and to assess safety .","['我们还招募了患者,他们的诊所人员对抗生素的好处不确定性,一个特点,以前的试验被批评为缺乏,49.50和试验得到了很好的能力,以检测抗生素暴露的微小差异,并评估安全性。']"
our trial had some limitations .,['我们的审判有一些限制。']
we did not directly address whether antibiotics can be safely withheld on the basis of a low procalcitonin level alone but rather tested the effect of a deployment strategy to promote the recommended use of the assay in clinical practice ( in a patient population in which the likelihood of antimicrobial use was intermediate ) .,"['我们没有直接讨论抗生素是否可以单独基于低细胞素水平的安全存储,而是测试实施策略的效果,以促进在临床实践中推荐使用测试(在患者群体中,抗微生物使用的可能性是中间的)。']"
"in our strategy , procalcitonin assay results were provided to the clinical team before decision making in most but not all instances .","['在我们的策略中,procalcitonin测试结果在大多数情况下,但不是所有情况下,在决策之前交给临床团队。']"
a lack of knowledge about the prescribing practices used by individual physicians limits the insights we can make .,['缺乏关于个体医生使用的处方实践的知识限制了我们所能做的洞察力。']
the potential effect of emerging technology that may improve the rapid identification of infectious agents - technology that was largely unavailable during the course of this trial - is unclear .,"['新兴技术的潜在影响,可以改善感染物的快速识别 - 该技术在这次试验期间在很大程度上是无法获得的 - 不清楚。']"

relief from angina was more pronounced after PCI than after medical therapy .,"['腹泻的缓解在PCI之后更为明显,而不是在医疗治疗后。']"
"in contrast , in patients with stable coronary artery disease , there is persistent controversy about the role and timing of PCI to improve clinical outcomes and provide symptomatic relief.6,7","['相反,在患有稳定的冠状动脉疾病的患者中,关于改善临床结果并提供症状缓解的PCI的作用和时间的持续争论。']"

"among the men who had had remission , those whose BMI had decreased to below the 75th percentile in early adulthood had risks of type 2 diabetes similar to those among men whose BMI had remained in the 25th to 49th percentiles , which indicated that the effects of overweight during childhood were reversible ( Table 4 ) .","['在患有衰退的男性中,早期成年时体重下降到75%以下的人患2型糖尿病的风险类似于男性中体重下降到25%至49%的男性中,这表明童年时体重过重的影响是可逆转的(图4)。']"
increases in BMI between 7 years of age and early adulthood were associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes .,['7岁及早期成年之间的BMI增加与2型糖尿病的风险增加有关。']
"within adult BMI groups , there was a tendency for the risk of type 2 diabetes to be higher among men in whom the BMI had been lower at 7 years of age .","['在成人BMI群体中,患2型糖尿病的风险在男性中较高,在7岁时BMI较低。']"

"moreover , despite strong inverse associations between indicators of socioeconomic status and type 2 diabetes , which has also been reported in other studies , 6 our results suggest that overweight increases the risk of type 2 diabetes through pathways that are unrelated to intelligence or education , since adjustment for these factors only minimally changed our results .","['此外,尽管社会经济状况和2型糖尿病的指标之间的强烈相反联系,这在其他研究中也被报道,6我们的结果表明,超重增加了2型糖尿病的风险,通过与智力或教育无关的路径,因为这些因素的调整只会尽量改变我们的结果。']"
it is biologically plausible that excess weight in childhood leads to type 2 diabetes through the early development of insulin resistance.28,"['生物可靠的是,在童年中体重过重导致2型糖尿病的早期发育胰岛素抵抗性。']"

subgroup analyses were conducted ( Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix ) .,['子组分析进行了(附件中的表 S3 )。']
"tests for the effects of duration were performed as likelihood ratio tests comparing risk models with no history of use , previous use , and durations of use ( or time since use ) with the corresponding model in which duration categories were collapsed into one category .","['长度效应的测试作为概率比例测试进行,比较没有使用历史、以前使用和使用时间(或使用后的时间)的风险模型与相应的模型,其中长度类别崩溃到一个类别。']"
Bonferroni correction was made for multiple comparisons in analyses comparing specific preparations with one another .,['Bonferroni 修复是在对特定制品进行比较的分析中进行的多种比较。']
we did not adjust for multiple comparisons in other analyses .,['我们在其他分析中没有调整多个比较。']
"characteristics of the study population are listed in Table 1 , and in Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix .","['研究人口的特点在表1中列出,并在附件S4中列出。']"
"the risk of breast cancer increased with the duration of use , from 1.09 ( 95 % CI , 0.96 to 1.23 ) with less than 1 year of use to 1.38 ( 95 % CI , 1.26 to 1.51 ) after more than 10 years of use ( P = 0.002 ) ( Table 2 ) .","['乳腺癌的风险随着使用时间增加,从 1.09 (95% CI, 0.96 到 1.23 ) 使用时间不到 1 年 到 1.38 (95% CI, 1.26 到 1.51 ) 使用时间超过 10 年 ( P = 0.002 ) ( 表 2 ) 。']"
"as compared with women who had never used hormonal contraception , an increased risk of breast cancer was observed among woman who had previously used hormonal contraception for long periods of time ( i.e. , ≥ 5 years ) .","['与从未使用过荷尔蒙避孕药的妇女相比,在以前长期使用荷尔蒙避孕药的妇女中,乳腺癌的风险增加(即5年以上)。']"
"among these women , the risk appeared to remain increased for at least 5 years after discontinuation ( Table 3 ) .","['在这些妇女中,风险似乎在中断后至少5年保持上升(图3)。']"
no increased risk was found among women who had previously used hormonal contraception for less than 5 years .,"['在以前使用荷尔蒙避孕药不到5年的女性中,没有发现增加风险。']"
there was little evidence of major differences among women who used various combined oral contraceptives ( Table 4 ) .,"['在使用各种合并口服避孕药的妇女中,显著差异的证据很少(图4)。']"
"few significant differences were detected when various preparations were compared , and the differences were no longer significant after adjustment for multiple testing .","['在比较不同制品时,发现了很少的显著差异,并且在多次测试调整后,差异不再显著。']"
risk estimates for combined pills containing norethisterone or levonorgestrel and 50 μg of estrogen were similar to combinations with the same progestins combined with 20 to 40 μg of estrogen ( Table 4 ) .,['包含诺埃蒂斯特隆或莱文奥格斯特雷尔和50 μg的雌激素的组合药物的风险估计与与20至40 μg的雌激素相似(图4)。']
"when analyses were adjusted for the estrogen dose in each product , the overall relative risk of breast cancer associated with current or recent use was attenuated ; the relative risk associated with gestodene products remained significantly elevated ( Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix ) .","['当分析对每个产品中的雌激素剂量进行调整时,与当前或最近使用相关的乳腺癌的总相对风险减少;与 gestodene 产品相关的相对风险仍然显著上升(附件中的 S5 表)。']"
"for each oral contraceptive containing 20 to 40 μg of estrogen , the risk of breast cancer appeared to depend on the duration of use , although the effect of duration was significant only for products containing gestodene ( P = 0.003 ) ( Table 5 ) .","['对于每种含有20至40毫克雌激素的口服避孕药,乳腺癌的风险似乎取决于使用时间,尽管使用时间的效果仅适用于含有<unk>素的产品(P=0.003)(图5)。']"
subgroup AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSES,['微型和敏感性分析']
each subgroup analysis had less precise risk estimates than the main analyses .,['每个子组分析都比主要分析少准确的风险估计。']
"even so , broadly similar risk patterns were observed among women who had used hormonal contraceptives for at least 5 years before inclusion in the analysis ( Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix ) .","['即使如此,在使用荷尔蒙避孕药至少5年之前加入分析的妇女中观察到广泛类似的风险模式(附件中的S6表)。']"
